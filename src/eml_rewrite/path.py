"""Cost-anneal path between two equivalent expressions.

Given ``start`` and ``end`` symbolic expressions believed to be
equivalent, ``path(start, end)`` returns the rewrite *sequence*
that walks from one to the other under the existing rewrite library
with monotonically non-increasing cost — or ``None`` if no such
path exists within the configured search budget.

Algorithm: best-first search on expression-graph. Nodes are
SymPy expressions; edges are individual rewrites from
:func:`suggest` (with ``only_improvements=False`` so we can also
admit cost-neutral rewrites that bridge the two endpoints).
Priority key = predicted cost; the search prunes any branch whose
post-rewrite cost exceeds the source-side cost (monotone-decrease
constraint).

Use cases:

  * **Pedagogy.** "Why is the simplified form simpler?" — the
    rewrite sequence is the answer, step by step.
  * **Differential rewriting.** Two equivalent expressions in
    different files; the path explains the diff.
  * **Reproducible simplification.** Save + replay a path to
    canonicalize new expressions through the same lens.

The search is bounded by ``max_steps`` (default 6) and
``max_frontier`` (default 256). On budget exhaustion the function
returns ``None`` rather than partial output, so callers can rely
on a non-``None`` return being a complete path.
